There's 3 folders in this repo:
1. "docs" filled with html files 
2. "images" filled with image sources used in html

The Flow:

Users cannot use the services and take a peek inside if they don't have account. So the page starts in login page and to get in user can use 2 ways to get in, either to get in by log in into their account or sign up to make a new account.
After they get in they can use any features like borrow cars from us or lend their cars to us.
